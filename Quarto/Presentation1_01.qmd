#### A Gorgeous Presentation for Your Business

Brought to you by **Cardinal**

This revealjs presentation seeks to showcase the power of HTML presentations. HTML can do what powerpoint can't (or at least not as elegantly). 

And here we prove it.

```{r}

library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=72.64211517160314, lat=34.06960235636041, popup="Here we are")

#### Approach A: Powerpoint

Powerpoint's presentation structures can be rigid and uninteractive. 

Presentations usually only go in the direction the presenter arranged it. 

How many times have you found yourself jumping around slides in response to a question from the audience?

#### Approach B: HTML 

HTML presentations can make presentations more dynamic.

Quotations create context and continuity:

<blockquote>

Powerpoint presentations too often resemble a schoolplay - very loud, very slow, and very simple.<sup>&#128481;</sup>

-- Edward Tufte

* Emojis help audience make quick evaluations and release tension
