**First HK Theorem**

</div>

<!-- The ground state energy $E$ from Schrodinger's equation is a unique functional of electron density $n(r)$.\\
The ground state energy of a system is uniquely determined by the ground state electron density. -->

For any system of interacting particles in an external potential $V_{ext}(\vec{r})$, the potential $V_{ext}(\vec{r})$ is determined uniquely by the ground state particle density $n_0(r)$.

$$
E_{ground} = E[n(r)]

**Second HK Theorem**

</div>

The density that minimizes the energy functional is the exact ground state density 

$$
E_{o} \leq E_{trial} = \int \psi_{trial}^* \hat{H} \psi_{trial}
