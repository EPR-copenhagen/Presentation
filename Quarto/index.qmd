## Medium is Message

Arrange information side by side to make elegant comparisons.

#### Approach A: Powerpoint

Powerpoint's presentation structures can be rigid and uninteractive. 

Presentations usually only go in the direction the presenter arranged it. 

How many times have you found yourself jumping around slides in response to a question from the audience?

::: {.column }
#### Approach B: HTML 

HTML presentations can make presentations more dynamic.

:::
::::

Quotations create context and continuity:

<blockquote>

Powerpoint presentations too often resemble a schoolplay - very loud, very slow, and very simple.<sup>&#128481;</sup>

-- Edward Tufte

* Emojis help audience make quick evaluations and release tension
